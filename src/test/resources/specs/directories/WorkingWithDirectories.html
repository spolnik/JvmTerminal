    <h1>JvmTerminal - working with directories!</h1>

    <p>
    	After a user runs terminal, he creates new directory
        and display content of working directory to see a new directory.

        Then he goes into it and displays working directory path.

        Later he goes back to parent directory,
        he removes created directory
        and finally he lists content to see if a directory was removed.

    <div class="example">

		<h3>Creating and removing new directory</h3>
		
        <p>
            When user opens terminal
            he creates new directory <b concordion:set="#dirName">dir_name</b>,
            <span concordion:execute="createDirectory(#dirName)" />
            then he lists content of working directory to confirm it was
            <b concordion:assertEquals="isDirectoryCreated(#dirName)">created</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Then he goes to newly created directory
            <span concordion:execute="changeWorkingDirectory(#dirName)" />
            and displays working directory path which should ends with
            <b concordion:assertEquals="workingDirectoryName()">dir_name</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Later he goes back to parent<span concordion:execute="goToParentDir()" />,
            he removes created directory
            <span concordion:execute="removeDirectory(#dirName)" />
            and finally he lists content to see if the directory was
            <b concordion:assertEquals="isRemoved(#dirName)">removed</b>.
